This dataset provides the information submitted to government for the year 2016/17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It includes mandatory data on the number of single use carrier bags sold under the charge, gross proceeds, any costs and used of the net proceeds (columns B to O) and voluntary data on any amounts donated and the type of good causes in receipt of any donations plus information on the number of paper bags or bags for life issued by retailers.

Columns B - O  (Mandatory information),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gross proceeds:  This is the number of bags x charge for the bags.  Note that charge of each bag may not calculate to be 5p in all cases. Some retailers charge more than 5p per bag and in some cases may use two different rates where they sell different types of bag; one may be marketed as reusable but is not classed as a bag for life. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VAT:  The standard VAT rate  is  20% but retailers have the opportunity not to use this default and provide their own figures and in some cases have a different rate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cost deducted:  Where  applicable, a breakdown of reasonable costs are shown in columns F to K of the data. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Net proceeds:  Gross proceeds - VAT - costs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Use of net proceeds:  In a few cases retailers have added comments that they intend to make donations but these have not yet been made, so some have recorded as 'donated' whereas others have recorded as 'retained'. Some retailers also have charitable status and have retained the proceeds.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Columns P - T  (Voluntary information),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amount donated to good causes:  This is the amount donated to good causes. In some cases this is higher than the net proceeds where retailers have decided to donate a higher amount.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good causes in receipt of proceed donation:   Covers the  different good causes  retailers have donated to. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Any other information:  Covers additional information provided by retailers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
